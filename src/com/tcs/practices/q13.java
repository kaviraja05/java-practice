/*
Note : 1st element of the array should be considered in the count of the result.

For example
Arr[]={7,4,8,2,9}
As 7 is the first element, it will consider in the result.
8 and 9 are also the elements that are greater than all of its previous elements.
Since total of  3 elements is present in the array that meets the condition.
Hence the output = 3.
